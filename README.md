# Sudoku-Game-Solver || Sudoku Solver in C++  

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a **Sudoku Solver**. It provides an efficient solution to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle by filling in the empty cells while ensuring the constraints of Sudoku are met.  

## Features  
- Reads a Sudoku puzzle as input.  
- Solves the puzzle using a **backtracking algorithm**.  
- Validates input to ensure it conforms to Sudoku rules.  
- Outputs the solved puzzle in a clean and readable format.  

## Getting Started  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CyberPratik/Sudoku-Game-Solver.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sudoku-solver
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ sudoku_solver.cpp -o sudoku_solver
4. Run the program and input your Sudoku puzzle:
   ```bash
   ./sudoku_solver

## How It Works
1. Uses recursion and backtracking to find the solution.
2. Checks for valid placements of numbers in each cell before proceeding.
3. Stops when a solution is found or confirms if the puzzle is unsolvable.

## Applications
- Helps solve Sudoku puzzles quickly and efficiently.
- Can be extended or integrated into other projects like puzzle generators or mobile apps.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the algorithm or adding features, feel free to open a pull request.
